```
As a user,
So I can access the bookmarks I've created,
I want to be able to view a list of all of my bookmarks.

As a user,
So I can find the information I need from a bookmark later,
I want to add new bookmarks to my personal list.

As a user,
So I can organise my bookmarks by topic,
I want to be able to tag bookmarks with a relevant word.

As a user,
So I can find a specific bookmark more easily,
I want to return a filtered list of my bookmarks using a tag.
